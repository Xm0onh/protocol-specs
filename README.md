This repository contains the formal specifications of the Subspace Network protocol. For a more approachable description of the protocol, check out the [Subnomicon](https://subnomicon.subspace.network), which provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of protocol.

Ideally, the specification in this repository should be considered the canonical source of truth for the Subspace Network protocol. Currently, the specifications do not cover the full stack, but it is one of the goals of the project to do so.

New developments to the [protocol code](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/pulls) should be preceded by a pull request to this repository, accompanied by a discussion in the [Forum](https://forum.subspace.network) to ensure that the stakeholders are aligned on the changes. If there is not yet a relevant section in the specifications, consider adding it to help cover the new (or updated) functionality.
When the existing implementation is found to diverge from the specifications, the implementation should be considered a bug. 
If you have any additions or corrections, please submit a pull request.
