The purpose of this page is to serve as a gateway to existing technical specifications of various parts of the Subspace Network protocol in its current state. The following specifications reflect the current state of the protocol and are subject to updates as the protocol evolves.

## Essential Primitives

- [Essential Primitives](crypto_primitives.md)

## Dilithium Consensus Protocol

- [General Consensus Sub-protocols](./consensus/consensus_chain.md)

- [Proof-of-Archival-Storage](./consensus/proof_of_archival_storage.md) 

- [Proof-of-Space](./consensus/proof_of_space.md)
